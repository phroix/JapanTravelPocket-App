# JapanTravelPocket-App
The Japan Travel Pocket App is a personal tool designed for my semester abroad in Japan. It consists of three main pages:

- Currency Converter: This page fetches the latest exchange rates for Japanese Yen and Euro, allowing you to easily convert currencies without needing to search online.

- Expense Tracker: As a student, managing daily expenses is crucial. This page allows users to log daily expenses, categorize them with editable tags, and monitor spending habits.

- Travel Diary: The final page is a travel diary where you can document your visits to various locations, detailing activities and experiences.

The app is powered by a Supabase database and a custom API built with Node.js, ensuring reliable data management and seamless performance.
